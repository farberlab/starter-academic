I am a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Charles Farber's lab at the University of Virginia. I'm currently interested in the systems genetics of complex traits, and my current research deals with unraveling the systems genetics underlying bone strength and strength-related traits. 

In my research, I utilize computational tools and methods, such as transcriptomic network learning, as well as molecular biology bench work, in order to further understand the genetics underlying bone strength.
