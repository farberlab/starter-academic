Atum Buo, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Public Health Genomics. Atum specializes in bone research and his current work focuses on elucidating the impact of genetic variation on bone strength and skeletal health. Dr. Buo hopes that his research will lead to the discovery of new genes that play a role in bone strength and ultimately contribute to the development of therapies against bone diseases such as osteoporosis.
